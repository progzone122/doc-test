## Get boot logs

Clone the [workarounds script repo](https://github.com/moto-penangf/fuckyoumoto) and poweroff your phone.

Run `get_logs.sh` and connect the phone to the pc.
You'll find the dumped logs inside the `exported_logs` directory

> [!NOTE]
> Device specific information (IMEI, SERIAL NUMBER) are automatically removed from the logs
